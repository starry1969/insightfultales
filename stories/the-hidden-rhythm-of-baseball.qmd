## [🧢]{aria-hidden="true"} The Game That Breathes

Baseball isn’t timed by a clock, but it still has a **tempo**. Some eras feel quick and scrappy, others patient and thunderous. In this story, we’ll *listen* to that tempo using long‑run league averages. If you don’t speak data — no problem. Think of every chart as a **stethoscope** on the game’s chest.

### [🧰]{aria-hidden="true"} What data are we using?

We’ll use the well‑known **Lahman** database (public, free) through R. We’ll count simple things anyone can grasp: **runs**, **home runs**, **walks**, **strikeouts**, and **stolen bases**. From these counts, we compute commonsense rates, like “home runs **per plate appearance**.”

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(Lahman)

# Safe rate helper
rate <- function(n, d) ifelse(d > 0, n / d, NA_real_)

# Build league-level season summary from Teams
season <- Teams %>%
  transmute(
    year = yearID,
    g   = G,
    r   = R,
    hr  = HR,
    bb  = BB,
    so  = SO,
    sb  = SB,
    ab  = AB,
    hbp = coalesce(HBP, 0L),
    sf  = coalesce(SF, 0L),
    pa  = AB + BB + hbp + sf
  ) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    g      = sum(g,  na.rm = TRUE),
    r_pg   = rate(sum(r,  na.rm = TRUE), g),
    # Use summed plate appearances; if pa has gaps early on, fall back to AB+BB
    pa_sum = sum(pa, na.rm = TRUE),
    abbb   = sum(ab + bb, na.rm = TRUE),
    denom  = ifelse(pa_sum > 0, pa_sum, abbb),

    hr_pa  = rate(sum(hr, na.rm = TRUE), denom),
    bb_pa  = rate(sum(bb, na.rm = TRUE), denom),
    so_pa  = rate(sum(so, na.rm = TRUE), denom),
    sb_pa  = rate(sum(sb, na.rm = TRUE), denom)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  mutate(
    # 5-year right-aligned moving average using base R (no zoo needed)
    rpg_roll5 = as.numeric(stats::filter(r_pg, rep(1/5, 5), sides = 1)),
    tto_share = hr_pa + bb_pa + so_pa,
    bip_share = pmax(0, 1 - tto_share)
  )
```

**Decoder**

-   *per PA* ≈ per trip to the plate.

-   *Runs per game* = average runs a team scores in a game that year.

-   *Balls in play* = anything that isn’t a HR, walk, or strikeout.
:::

## [🎼]{aria-hidden="true"} A Heartbeat You Can See: Runs Per Game

If the game were breathing, **runs per game** would be its chest rising and falling. Peaks = lively offense. Valleys = pitcher‑dominated eras.

```{r}
season %>%
    ggplot(aes(year, r_pg)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 0.85) +
    geom_line(aes(y = rpg_roll5), linewidth = 1.1) +
    labs(
        title = "Runs per Team Game over Time",
        subtitle = "The 5‑year smoother reveals gentle waves rather than a straight trend",
        x = NULL, y = "Runs per game"
    )
```

**What to notice:** The line **waves**. Offense doesn’t simply climb forever — it **surges and recedes** across generations.

## [💥]{aria-hidden="true"} Fewer Things Happen, Louder When They Do

Modern baseball increasingly ends in one of three ways: **home run, walk, or strikeout**. That means fewer balls are fielded. The game can *feel* slower between bursts of action, even while the big moments are bigger.

```{r}
season %>%
    select(year, hr_pa, bb_pa, so_pa) %>%
    pivot_longer(-year, names_to = "metric", values_to = "rate"
    ) %>%
    mutate(
        metric = recode(metric,
        hr_pa = "Home runs per PA",
        bb_pa = "Walks per PA",
        so_pa = "Strikeouts per PA")
    ) %>%
    ggplot(aes(year, rate, linetype = metric)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(
        title = "The Three True Outcomes over Time",
        subtitle = "Share per plate appearance (league average)",
        x = NULL, y = "Rate"
    )
```

**What to notice:** Strikeouts climb steadily; home runs rise in bursts; walks bob up and down. Together they take up **more of the action pie**.

## [🧶]{aria-hidden="true"} Thread Count: How Much Play Is *In* Play?

Let’s peek at the **share of balls in play** — the portion of plate appearances that *require* a fielder to do something.

```{r}
season %>%
    ggplot(aes(year, bip_share)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(
        title = "Balls In Play as a Share of All Plate Appearances",
        subtitle = "When this falls, the game has fewer fielding plays and more all‑or‑nothing outcomes",
        x = NULL, y = "Share (0–1)"
    )
```

**What to notice:** When this dips, the game’s rhythm changes — fewer sprints and throws, more waiting for the next big swing.

## [🏃]{aria-hidden="true"} Speed’s Comeback Arc

Steals add heartbeat. Their rise and fall shows how teams toggle between **risk** and **power**.

```{r}
season %>%
    ggplot(aes(year, sb_pa)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(
        title = "Stolen Bases per Plate Appearance",
        subtitle = "Risk tolerance in motion",
        x = NULL, y = "SB per PA"
    )
```

**What to notice:** Cycles. The sport rediscovering speed isn’t nostalgia — it’s ecology. When defenses and pitchers neutralize power, **movement** becomes valuable again.

## [🌀]{aria-hidden="true"} A Simple “Zeit Rhythm” Index

To summarize the *feel* of an era, we blend four dials:

-   **Power** (HR/PA)

-   **Miss** (SO/PA)

-   **Movement** (SB/PA)

-   **Play in the Field** (Balls in play share, but we subtract it — less BIP = more all‑or‑nothing feel)

The result is a single line: higher = louder, burstier baseball; lower = more contact‑heavy flow.

```{r}
zi <- season %>%
  mutate(across(c(hr_pa, so_pa, sb_pa, bip_share), scale)) %>%
  mutate(ZI = as.numeric(hr_pa + so_pa + sb_pa - bip_share)) %>%
  mutate(ZI_roll5 = as.numeric(stats::filter(ZI, rep(1/5, 5), sides = 1))) %>%
  select(year, ZI, ZI_roll5)



zi %>% 
    ggplot(aes(year, ZI)) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linewidth = 0.3) +
    geom_line(alpha = 0.55) +
    geom_line(aes(y = ZI_roll5), linewidth = 1.1) +
    labs(
        title = "Zeit Rhythm Index",
        subtitle = "A blended, z‑scored feel of power + miss + movement − balls in play",
        x = NULL, y = "Index (0 ≈ average era)"
    )
```

**What to notice:** The line **oscillates in multi‑decade waves** rather than drifting randomly — a hint that baseball self‑corrects when any one style takes over.

## [🔭]{aria-hidden="true"} What This Suggests Next

-   **Contact renaissance**: As pitchers and defenses optimize for strikeouts and power prevention, putting the ball in play may regain value — not as nostalgia, but as an *edge*.

-   **Smart speed**: Selective stealing and hit‑and‑run tactics may return in pockets where they exploit pitcher/catcher timing.

-   **Fielding theater**: If leagues want more visible action, rule tweaks that increase balls in play could shift the rhythm again.

## [📦]{aria-hidden="true"} Reproducibility Notes

-   **Source**: The public **Lahman** database via the `Lahman` R package.

-   **Averages**: We averaged teams into a single league line per year to hear the broad rhythm (details will vary by ballpark or league).

-   **Approximations**: Older seasons are missing some counts (like sacrifice flies). We used simple, conservative fallbacks that don’t change the big picture.

-   **Smoothing**: A gentle 5‑year average makes the waves easier to see.
