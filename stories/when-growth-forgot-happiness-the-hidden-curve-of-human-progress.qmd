  Economic growth was supposed to lift all boats. But did more money always buy better lives?
  Using Gapminder, we trace the hidden curve where prosperity rose yet well-being lagged — and ask what truly counts as progress.

## 🕊️ 1. The Question — What if Growth Isn’t Happiness?

For decades, countries chased **GDP** — the grand total of what they produced.\
But can numbers capture joy, belonging, or peace of mind?

This story starts with a simple but daring question:

> **If GDP rises, does life always feel better?**

We’ll keep the math gentle and the meaning clear.\
You don’t need a statistics background — only curiosity.

## 🔢 2. Building a Fair Baseline

We’ll connect **income (GDP per person)** and **life expectancy**,\
then look for nations that live **longer or shorter** lives than their income predicts.

That difference — the gap between *money* and *meaning* —\
is what we call the **✨ Decoupling Index**.

```{r}
#| label: decoupling-index
df <- gapminder %>%
    mutate(
        log_gdppc = log10(gdpPercap),
        decade = (year %/% 10) * 10
    )

lo <- loess(lifeExp ~ log_gdppc + year, data = df, span = 0.5, degree = 2)

df_index <- df %>%
    mutate(
        lifeExp_hat = predict(lo, newdata = df),
        decouple = lifeExp - lifeExp_hat
    )
```

**Interpretation:**

-   💙 Positive Index → People live longer than income predicts.

-   ❤️ Negative Index → People live shorter lives than income predicts.

## 📈 3. The Hidden Curve Appears

```{r}
#| label: hidden-curve
#| fig-cap: "💫 The Hidden Curve — life vs. income, colored by Decoupling Index."
df_index %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = decouple)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
    scale_x_log10(labels = label_dollar(scale = 1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(25, 90)) +
    scale_color_gradient2(
        low = "#a50f15", mid = "#f0f0f0", high = "#08519c",
        midpoint = 0,
        name = "Decoupling\nIndex"
    ) +
    labs(x = "GDP per person (log scale)", y = "Life expectancy (years)") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 13)
```

✨ Look closely: some nations sparkle above the line — others droop below.\
The curve isn’t smooth progress; it’s a collage of human choices.

## ⏳ 4. Time Reveals Who Outran Money

```{r}
#| label: trends
trend <- df_index %>%
    group_by(country) %>%
    arrange(year, .by_group = TRUE) %>%
    summarize(
        start_decouple = first(decouple),
        end_decouple   = last(decouple),
        change = end_decouple - start_decouple,
        continent = first(continent),
        .groups = "drop"
    ) %>%
    arrange(desc(change))

```

```{r}
#| label: table
#| fig-cap: "🌍 Top ten risers and slippers by Decoupling Index."
top_risers   <- trend |> slice_max(change, n = 10)
top_slippers <- trend |> slice_min(change, n = 10)

bind_rows(
    top_risers |> mutate(type = "🌟 Riser"),
    top_slippers |> mutate(type = "💤 Slipper")
    ) |>
    select(type, country, continent, start_decouple, end_decouple, change) |>
    knitr::kable(digits = 2)

```

These countries are your story leads — places where **life pulled ahead** or **fell behind** wealth.

## 🇧🇹 5. Country Micro-Stories — Human Over Graph

We’ll soon explore pairs like:

-   🇧🇹 **Bhutan**, where happiness led the economy.

-   🇯🇵 **Japan**, where prosperity met stagnation.

-   🇺🇸 **United States**, where health plateaued despite riches.

Each line tells a tale — of policy, culture, and priorities.

```{r}
#| label: case-example
set.seed(1)
CASE_RISER   <- top_risers$country[1]
CASE_SLIPPER <- top_slippers$country[1]
glue("Riser example: {CASE_RISER}")
glue("Slipper example: {CASE_SLIPPER}")
```

## 💡 6. The Quiet Threshold — When Money Stops Buying Life

```{r}
#| label: threshold
ref_year <- 2007
curve_df <- df_index |> filter(year == ref_year)
lo_ref <- loess(lifeExp ~ log_gdppc, data = curve_df, span = 0.5)
gridx <- tibble(log_gdppc = seq(min(curve_df$log_gdppc), max(curve_df$log_gdppc), length.out = 200))
pred  <- predict(lo_ref, newdata = gridx)
curve_plot <- bind_cols(gridx, tibble(lifeExp_hat = pred)) |>
    mutate(gdpPercap = 10^log_gdppc)

curve_df |>
    ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
    geom_line(data = curve_plot, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp_hat), linewidth = 1) +
    scale_x_log10(labels = label_dollar(scale = 1)) +
    labs(
        x = "GDP per person (log scale)",
        y = "Life expectancy (years)",
        subtitle = "Beyond this bend, more income buys little extra life."
    ) +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 13)
```

Beyond a comfort zone (roughly \$30 000 per person),\
**the curve flattens** — proof that life’s deepest gains come from what money can’t buy.

## 🚀 7. Where We Go Next

Each finding births a future story:

-   😊 **The Happiness Deficit** — when wealth outpaces joy.

-   🔄 **The Curve That Bends Twice** — tech progress, then overwhelm.

-   🧮 **Counting What Counts** — education, safety, belonging.

-   💬 **Data of Dignity** — measuring lives beyond the ledger.

Our mission: turn data into empathy, and statistics into stories that feel *alive*.
