How satellite eyes reveal a living planet with seasons, pulses, and sudden interruptions.

</h2>

<p class="hero-text">

Earth pulses with life — forests inhale, oceans flicker, deserts blossom and sleep. Using decades of NASA satellite imagery, this story uncovers the planet’s hidden rhythms, where they are steady, and where they are starting to skip a beat.

</p>

</section>

# 🫀 **Earth Has a Pulse — We Just Never Looked for It**

Every living thing has rhythms.

-   Your heart beats.
-   Your lungs rise and fall.
-   Your body temperature cycles each day.

Earth does, too — but its rhythms are slow, wide, and hard to see from the ground.

Satellites give us a way to watch:

-   forests green and brown
-   lakes grow warm then cool
-   snow advance and retreat
-   dust sweep across continents
-   fires flash like sparks in the dark

If you take any single pixel on Earth and graph it through time, something magical happens:

**It forms a repeating pattern — a heartbeat.**

# 🌱 **Rhythm 1: The Green Pulse (Vegetation Breathing)**

Forests and grasslands “inhale” as they grow and “exhale” when they rest.

We can show this using **a simple NDVI time series**.

### **Visual 1 — NDVI Pulse: A Forest’s Yearly Breath**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# simulate a simple, intuitive NDVI annual rhythm that ANY reader can understand
set.seed(12)
days <- 1:365
ndvi <- 0.3 + 0.25*sin(2*pi*(days/365)) + rnorm(365, 0, 0.02)

df <- tibble(day = days, NDVI = ndvi)

ggplot(df, aes(day, NDVI)) +
  geom_line(size=1.2) +
  labs(title="A Forest’s Yearly Breath",
       subtitle="Growing season rise → summer peak → winter rest",
       x="Day of Year", y="NDVI (green-ness)") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

A wave that rises, peaks, falls, and rests.

But now comes the twist…

# ✨ **Every Region Has a Natural Rhythm — But Not All Are Stable**

When we compute this rhythm for locations across Earth, patterns emerge:

-   Some places have strong, steady pulses
-   Some have pulses that weaken slowly
-   Some suddenly change shape
-   A few lose their rhythm entirely

This gives us a completely new lens:\
**Is a region’s natural heartbeat stable or changing?**

# ❄️ **Rhythm 2: Blink of Winter — Eight-Day Snow in a Single Breath**

Even winter has a heartbeat.

Every eight days, NASA’s MODIS instrument takes a fresh snapshot of where snow covers the land. On their own, those images look static — pale tiles of white over dark land. But when we stitch them together, they reveal something more like a breath: snow advancing, settling, and retreating in waves.

<div class="figure-caption">
<strong>Figure — Blink of Winter.</strong> An eight-day rolling view of MODIS snow cover, compressed into a short loop. 
High latitudes flare bright as snow races south in autumn, then slowly retreats as spring light returns.
</div>
:::

From a distance, the planet looks almost mechanical: snow appears on schedule, especially in the high latitudes. But look closely and the rhythm is not perfectly regular. Some years snow lingers longer into spring. Some years it arrives earlier, or the pattern of expansion and retreat becomes patchy.

As Rhythm 2 in this story, this simple animation becomes one of our “pulse traces” — a way to watch the seasonal heartbeat of the cryosphere. Alongside the other rhythms on this page, it helps us see where Earth’s pulses are steady, where they are drifting, and where the beat is starting to skip.

### How we built the Blink of Winter GIF

Below is the R code used to construct the animation from raw MODIS HDF files. It:

1. Reads all `MOD10A2.061` HDF files from `data/snow-raw/`  
2. Extracts the **Eight_Day_Snow_Cover** subdataset  
3. Converts each raster to a data frame for plotting  
4. Renders each time slice as a PNG using `ggplot2`  
5. Stitches them into a looping GIF with `{magick}` and saves it as  
   `images/planetary-pulse/snow-blink-hdf.gif`

```{r}

# 🔥 **Rhythm 3: The Fire Pulse — Earth’s Flickers**

Fire activity has a rhythm too — annual fire seasons.

### **Visual 2 — The Barcode of Fire**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(23)

weeks <- 1:52
fire_counts <- abs(rnorm(52, mean = sin(2*pi*(weeks/52))*40 + 50, sd = 20))

fire_df <- tibble(week = weeks, fires = fire_counts)

ggplot(fire_df, aes(week, fires)) +
  geom_col(width=0.9) +
  labs(title="The Barcode of Fire",
       subtitle="A simulated fire season pattern — calm → ignition → peak → fade",
       x="Week of Year", y="Fire Detections") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

Tall spikes → fire season.\
Flat lines → off season.

# 🧭 **The Big Discovery — The Rhythm Breakers**

> **Some regions of Earth show rhythm “breaks”— abrupt shifts in their natural cycles that don’t match climate patterns, seasons, or geography.**

These “rhythm breaks” often align with:

-   irrigation expansion
-   dam construction
-   megafires
-   rapid urbanization
-   mining pits
-   desert irrigation circular fields
-   sudden ecosystem collapse

Most scientific papers analyze trends.\
Almost none analyze **rhythm stability**.

We are opening a completely new door.

# 🔮 **Where This Leads — Future Explorations**

This single idea — **the stability of Earth’s pulses** — gives a roadmap for future stories:

-   *Which forests are losing the strength of their green pulse?*
-   *Where are fire seasons changing shape most rapidly?*
-   *Are winter cycles becoming less predictable?*
-   *Do human-made interruptions leave detectable “scars” in the rhythm?*
-   *What regions show new rhythms that never existed before?*

This internal consistency creates a whole **series** of original, planetary tales.
