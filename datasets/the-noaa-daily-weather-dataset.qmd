## <span aria-hidden="true">🪶</span> A Planet’s Daily Logbook

If the Earth kept a diary, the **NOAA Daily Weather dataset** would be its journal — quietly recording what happened in the sky each day, everywhere.\
From sweltering July afternoons in Texas to silent January snow in Maine, each entry captures our atmosphere’s daily rhythm.\
And collectively, they reveal the long memory of weather that shapes our lives.

## <span aria-hidden="true">🧭</span> Origins — From Observers to Databases

The story begins in the late 19th century.\
Long before satellites and sensors, weather was measured by hand — **Cooperative Observer Program (COOP)** volunteers using thermometers and rain gauges.\
In 1890, the U.S. Weather Bureau (now the **National Weather Service**) organized these thousands of observers to provide a daily national picture.

By the 1930s, these logs were centralized under what became the **National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)** — and eventually **NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)**.\
Their mission was simple but monumental: **preserve the planet’s weather memory**.

Today, the result is the **Global Historical Climatology Network – Daily (GHCN-Daily)**, containing billions of daily records from over 100,000 land-based stations across 180 countries.

> “Climate is what you expect. Weather is what you get.” — Robert Heinlein\
> This dataset captures *both.*

## <span aria-hidden="true">🌍</span> What It Contains

| Element       | Description                        | Example Variable |
|:--------------|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------|
| Temperature   | Daily maximum & minimum (°C or °F) | TMAX, TMIN       |
| Precipitation | Total daily precipitation          | PRCP             |
| Snowfall      | Daily snow accumulation            | SNOW             |
| Snow Depth    | Depth of snow on the ground        | SNWD             |

Each station reports one row per day — a simple rhythm of measurements stretching back, in some places, over **150 years**.

NOAA also provides derived gridded versions, such as **nClimGrid-Daily**, mapping these station observations onto a fine grid across the contiguous U.S. from **1951 to present**, enabling spatial analyses of heatwaves, droughts, or flood events.

## <span aria-hidden="true">💡</span> Why It Matters

The NOAA Daily Weather dataset is more than just numbers — it’s **context**.\
Every datapoint tells part of a larger story about life on Earth.

-   **Time Depth:** Enables century-scale climate studies — tracking heatwaves, cold snaps, and rainfall shifts.
-   **Daily Resolution:** Lets us see change as it happens — from one sunrise to the next.
-   **Geographic Breadth:** A single, unified record spanning the globe’s landmasses.
-   **Quality-Controlled:** Built with decades of standardization and statistical checks.
-   **Open Access:** Available freely to the public via [NOAA’s Climate Data Online (CDO)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/).

From farmers planning crops to engineers modeling heat stress on power grids — to storytellers like us connecting data to meaning — the dataset quietly underpins much of what we know about weather and climate.

## <span aria-hidden="true">🧩</span> What Makes It Unique

1.  **It’s the everyday data that becomes history.**\
    While headlines capture hurricanes, this dataset records *the calm before the storm* — the slow shifts that define climate.
2.  **It connects disciplines.**\
    Weather data intersects naturally with agriculture, transportation, energy, health, and even economics.\
    For instance, in <span aria-hidden="true">🦋</span> [Butterfly Morning Delays](../stories/butterfly-morning-delays.qmd) story, flight delays could easily be paired with daily precipitation and wind records.
3.  **It’s global, yet personal.**\
    Because it’s station-based, you can zoom from the planetary to the hyperlocal — even “my town on my birthday.”
4.  **It’s science you can touch.**\
    Each number once came from a real thermometer, a real place, a real moment in time.

## <span aria-hidden="true">🧮</span> Example Exploration

Imagine this:\
You download 50 years of daily maximum temperatures for your city and plot how many summer days exceeded 95 °F each year.\
You’d likely see the creeping signature of a warming world.

Or perhaps you cross-match rainfall with flight delays, crop yields, or local power consumption.\
Suddenly, weather becomes *behavioral data* — showing how the sky shapes our choices below.

``` r
# Example R snippet for NOAA Daily Summaries
library(rnoaa)
library(dplyr)

# Pull last 30 years of daily summaries for a station
ghcnd_stations() |> 
  filter(grepl("LITTLE ROCK", name)) |> 
  slice_head(n = 1) |> 
  pull(id) -> station_id

data <- meteo_pull_monitors(station_id, date_min = "1995-01-01", var = c("TMAX", "TMIN", "PRCP"))

data |> 
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(date)) |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarise(hot_days = sum(TMAX > 35, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ggplot(aes(year, hot_days)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Number of Hot Days (TMAX > 35°C) per Year",
       y = "Count", x = "Year")
```

This small snippet turns daily data into an evolving climate portrait.
