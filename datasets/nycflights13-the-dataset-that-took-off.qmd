## <span aria-hidden="true">🗽</span> A Dataset Born in the Skies Above New York

In 2013, nearly **337,000 flights** departed from New York City’s three major airports — JFK, LaGuardia (LGA), and Newark (EWR).\
Each of those flights left behind a trace: departure times, delays, destinations, aircraft numbers, even weather conditions at takeoff.

Years later, these traces would find their way into a small, elegantly crafted R package called **`nycflights13`**, and that package would go on to become one of the **most iconic learning tools in modern data science**.

## <span aria-hidden="true">🧭</span> The Origins: A Teaching Tool With Real-World Grit

The story begins with **Hadley Wickham**, the statistician and software developer who spearheaded much of the *tidyverse* — a family of R packages that revolutionized how data is handled and visualized.

In the early 2010s, Wickham was building resources to help people *learn data science by doing*, not by reading about artificially perfect examples.
Real data is messy, relational, and full of missing values — and that’s exactly what students and practitioners need to experience.

So instead of another toy dataset, Wickham turned to the **U.S. Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)**, which publishes open flight-on-time data.\
From this raw source — hundreds of thousands of records across dozens of fields — he curated a **single-year extract**: all flights departing from the New York City area during 2013.

Then, he went further.

He bundled in extra context:

-    **Airlines**, mapping carrier codes to their full names.

-   **Airports**, with geographic coordinates and time zones.

-   **Planes**, including tail numbers, manufacturers, and years built.

-   **Weather**, hourly reports from each NYC airport.

The result wasn’t just a dataset — it was a *miniature world* of interlocking tables, ready to teach real-world data relationships.

## <span aria-hidden="true">🧩</span> A Dataset of Relationships

Unlike simpler datasets like *iris* or *mtcars*, `nycflights13` is **relational** — meaning its tables connect through shared keys:

-    Flights ↔ Airlines (via carrier code)

-   Flights ↔ Airports (via origin and destination codes)

-   Flights ↔ Planes (via tail number)

-   Flights ↔ Weather (via origin + date + hour)

This structure was intentional.
It allows learners to practice joining, grouping, filtering, and summarizing — the bread and butter of data science — within a single coherent story: *why do some flights arrive late, and what factors might explain it?*

Wickham described this as “a dataset that lets you learn the grammar of data manipulation using real noise, not just clean textbook numbers.”

## <span aria-hidden="true">🧮</span> Why 2013?

The year **2013** wasn’t random — it was chosen for **completeness and modern relevance**.\
By 2014, most of that year’s data had been validated and publicly available through the BTS’s *On-Time Performance* database.
It also represented a year with consistent reporting across all major U.S. carriers.

2013 was far enough into the modern airline data era (with GPS and electronic filing) to be reliable, yet recent enough to feel relevant for today’s analyses.

## <span aria-hidden="true">🌦️</span> From Raw Data to a Clean Package

To transform the messy BTS export into something usable, Wickham and the tidyverse team wrote R scripts to:

-    Parse CSVs from the **RITA** (Research and Innovative Technology Administration) portal.

-   Filter for flights with valid NYC origins.

-   Clean up time variables (like `dep_time` and `arr_time`) into numeric or datetime forms.

-   Normalize column names for clarity and consistency.

-   Add weather data from the **NOAA Integrated Surface Database** (ISD).

The result was a compact, easily loadable dataset: one command, `library(nycflights13)`, and the world of 2013’s New York skies appears at your fingertips.

## <span aria-hidden="true">📦</span> Joining the tidyverse

When it was first released in **2014**, `nycflights13` joined the ecosystem of demonstration datasets used in the new generation of R tutorials, books, and courses — particularly *R for Data Science*, first published in 2017.

By packaging the dataset, Wickham made it instantly reproducible and accessible:

``` r
install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
```

It quickly became the standard dataset for teaching **data wrangling (`dplyr`)**, **tidying (`tidyr`)**, and **visualization (`ggplot2`)**.\


Today, it appears in classrooms, Coursera courses, Kaggle tutorials, and research introductions worldwide.

## <span aria-hidden="true">🌍</span> Why It Matters

`nycflights13` endures because it’s a *microcosm of real life*.\
It captures delay frustrations, winter weather, airline competition, and the randomness of human systems.\
It also shows how separate data sources — flights, airports, weather, and aircraft — interconnect to form a coherent story.

It’s not about New York flights alone; it’s about **how we understand and model the world through data**.

In the same way the *iris* dataset taught generations of statisticians about classification, *nycflights13* has taught generations of data scientists about structure, relationships, and storytelling.

### <span aria-hidden="true">🔧</span> Structure at a Glance

| Table | Description | Rows | Key columns |
|----|----|----|----|
| `flights` | Every NYC departure in 2013 | 336,776 | `year`, `month`, `day`, `dep_time`, `arr_time`, `carrier`, `tailnum`, `origin`, `dest` |
| `airlines` | Carrier codes and full names | 16 | `carrier` |
| `airports` | All airports in the dataset | 1,458 | `faa` |
| `planes` | Aircraft manufacturing info | 3,322 | `tailnum` |
| `weather` | Hourly conditions for each airport | 26,115 | `origin`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour` |

### <span aria-hidden="true">📘</span> Legacy and Influence

The dataset’s success inspired a wave of similar projects:

-   **`fivethirtyeight`** — datasets from FiveThirtyEight journalism pieces.**`gapminder`** — Hans Rosling’s world development data.**`palmerpenguins`** — a modern, ecological replacement for *iris*.

But *nycflights13* remains unique in how it captures an entire real-world system, cleanly and reproducibly, in just a few megabytes.\
It’s still maintained under the **tidyverse organization on GitHub**, ensuring compatibility with modern R versions.

For many, it was the *first real dataset they ever analyzed* — and it’s still the one they remember.

### <span aria-hidden="true">✈️</span> In the End

`nycflights13` is not just about flights.\
It’s about the *journey* of data — from messy public records to a structured, teachable story.\
It’s about curiosity, reproducibility, and accessibility.\
And like the air traffic over New York, it continues to connect learners all over the world — one tidy join at a time.
