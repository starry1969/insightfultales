## 🌍 What This Dataset Is

**Short version:**\
Global night-light radiance from **VIIRS (500 m)** and historic **DMSP-OLS (1 km)**, capturing the luminous fingerprint of human presence — electricity, settlement, economic activity, and the glowing skin of cities across the planet.

**Why it exists:**\
Satellites don’t sleep. As the Earth turns into night, sensors like VIIRS and DMSP-OLS watch the world light up — cities, roads, fishing fleets, gas flares, industrial sites. Those photons are turned into gridded data products, pixel by pixel, year after year.

**Why it’s special:**

-   It covers **almost the entire planet**, **consistently**, for **decades**.\
-   It works especially well where **censuses are infrequent** or **economic statistics are unreliable**.\
-   It directly visualizes **electrification**, **urbanization**, and **inequality** without needing a survey form.

Night lights are one of the rare datasets where the first glance is already a story.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡 Why It’s Worthy

Traditional data answers questions like:\
\> “What is the GDP of this region?”\
\> “How many people live here?”

Night-time lights let us ask questions like:\
\> “Where does the world actually glow?”\
\> “Who is being left in the dark?”\
\> “Which cities are brightening, fading, or merging together?”

They are worthy because they:

-   **Bypass missing statistics.** In regions with weak statistical systems, night lights still tell us who has power (literally).\
-   **Reveal inequality.** The contrast between bright cores and dark peripheries is a visceral picture of uneven development.\
-   **Capture transitions.** Electrification, urban expansion, post-disaster recovery — all leave radiance fingerprints.\
-   **Provide a long time series.** DMSP-OLS reaches back to the early 1990s; VIIRS continues the story from the 2010s.

This dataset is a lantern in places where conventional numbers go missing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔭 Story Sparks

These are the kinds of storylines that Night-Time Lights make unusually vivid:

### 1. Urban Sprawl and the “Glow Radius”

Cities don’t just grow; they *leak light* into the hinterlands.

-   Track the **radius of detectable glow** around a city over time.\
-   See the difference between **compact** vs **sprawling** urban growth.\
-   Detect **leapfrog development** — distant bright patches appearing before the official maps are updated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Brightening vs Dimming Cities

Compare radiance traces for different cities:

-   Who is **brightening rapidly** (industrialization, new infrastructure)?\
-   Who is **stagnant** (plateaued brightness)?\
-   Who is **dimming** (conflict, economic crisis, depopulation)?

Night lights give you a kind of **“economic ECG”** for cities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Luminous Inequality

Place a bright city core next to a dark rural region:

-   The gradient between them is a map of **access to electricity**, **infrastructure**, and **opportunity**.\
-   Within a single city, radiance can reflect **neighborhood-level inequality** — some districts blaze, others barely glow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Coastal Metro Chains

From high altitude, metro regions merge into **continuous light corridors**:

-   The Eastern Seaboard of the US, the Pearl River Delta, the Tokyo–Osaka corridor, the Lagos coastline — all visible as **linked constellations**.\
-   These **polycentric megaregions** are easier to see in light than on political maps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Blackouts as Economic Fingerprints

Sudden drops in light reveal something went wrong:

-   Hurricanes, war, drought-driven power shortages, economic collapse.\
-   You can measure **how far** the darkness spreads and **how long** it takes the lights to return.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. The Rise of Megacities

Over decades, neighboring cities brighten and gradually merge into **continuous luminous blobs**:

-   Night lights make the transition to *“mega-urban”* forms **visually obvious**.\
-   They allow us to map when and where **true megacities** emerge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧱 Dataset Structure

Night-time lights are provided as gridded rasters. Two families matter most:

### 🛰️ VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB)

-   **Provider:** NASA / NOAA\
-   **Coverage:** Global, from 2012 onward\
-   **Spatial resolution:** \~500 m at nadir (DNB products often distributed at this scale)\
-   **Temporal resolution:**
    -   Daily (with weather, moon, cloud effects)\
    -   Monthly and annual **composites** for analysis\
-   **Measured quantity:** Top-of-atmosphere radiance
    -   Typically in **nW/cm²/sr**

**Strengths:**

-   Finer detail than DMSP-OLS\
-   Better calibration and dynamic range\
-   Designed with night-light science as a core use case

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🛰️ DMSP-OLS Night-Time Lights

-   **Provider:** U.S. Air Force / NOAA NGDC (now NCEI)\
-   **Coverage:** Global, \~1992–2013\
-   **Spatial resolution:** \~1 km\
-   **Temporal resolution:** Annual composites\
-   **Measured quantity:** “Digital number” 0–63 (relative brightness)

**Strengths:**

-   Long historical record — the backbone of early night-lights research\
-   Enables pre-VIIRS studies of urbanization and electrification

**Key limitation:**\
Bright city cores saturate at the maximum digital number, losing contrast inside very bright regions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧪 How Analysts Actually Use Night-Time Lights

Here are some common analysis patterns:

### 1. Urban Footprint Maps

-   Threshold radiance to identify **“lit” pixels**.\
-   Group connected lit pixels into **urban polygons**.\
-   Track **growth, fragmentation, and densification** of these footprints over time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Economic and Demographic Proxies

Use brightness as a proxy for:

-   Local **GDP** or **income**\
-   **Population** density (especially where census is missing or outdated)\
-   **Electrification** and infrastructure access

Researchers often fit models like:

-   *brightness → log(GDP)*\
-   *brightness per capita → energy usage*

Then they **project** these relationships into data-poor regions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Disaster, Conflict, and Recovery

Compare **before/after** composites:

-   Identify blackout regions after hurricanes, earthquakes, war.\
-   Measure **time to recovery** by tracking radiance trajectory.\
-   Distinguish **temporary outages** from longer-term economic damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Environmental and Ecological Studies

-   Map **light pollution** near sensitive ecosystems.\
-   Study correlations with **bird migration**, **insect decline**, or **sea turtle nesting**.\
-   Explore how human illumination spreads into previously dark environments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Infrastructure and “Phantom” Roads

New roads and industrial corridors can appear in night-lights data **before** they show up in official maps:

-   Faint linear features = **traffic and settlements** along new infrastructure.\
-   Analysts use this to track **informal development** and **frontier expansion**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚠️ Limitations and Caveats

Night lights are powerful — but not perfect. Important caveats:

-   **Saturation in bright cores**
    -   DMSP-OLS especially compresses the brightest cities into the same top brightness bin.\
-   **Sensor differences over time**
    -   Different DMSP satellites, then VIIRS — calibration and cross-sensor harmonization are non-trivial.\
-   **Clouds, snow, and atmosphere**
    -   Cloud cover, snow, and atmospheric conditions change apparent brightness.\
    -   Composites try to filter this out, but some artifacts remain.\
-   **Non-city light sources**
    -   Gas flares, fishing fleets, ships, and isolated industrial sites can look “city-like” if not masked.\
-   **Cultural and policy factors**
    -   Two regions with similar economic activity can differ in brightness due to lighting norms, efficiency, or regulations.

The guiding principle:  
> Night lights should be treated as **a noisy but invaluable proxy**, not a perfect measurement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧰 Practical Tips for Working With Night Lights

If you’re using this dataset inside an Insightful Tales analysis (or any analysis), a few habits help:

1.  **Prefer composites**
    -   Use monthly or annual composites rather than raw daily data for most stories.
2.  **Mask out non-urban sources**
    -   Use gas flare masks, water masks, and known fishing regions where possible.
3.  **Normalize across years and sensors**
    -   For long-term studies, use harmonized products or apply cross-sensor scaling.
4.  **Log-scale brightness**
    -   When visualizing, log-transform radiance to avoid a few bright cities dominating the map.
5.  **Combine with other layers**
    -   Pair with population grids, administrative boundaries, roads, or climate data to deepen interpretation.
6.  **Tell the uncertainty story too**
    -   Explicitly mention limitations; it builds trust and better stories.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
