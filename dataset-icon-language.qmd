<h1>[🔹]{aria-hidden="true"} The Insightful Tales Dataset Icon Language</h1>

<h2 class="hero-subtitle">

Every dataset has a badge. Every badge has a story.

</h2>

<p class="hero-text">

The cyan circles and abstract shapes you see across Insightful Tales aren’t just decoration. They’re a visual language: a way of hinting at what each dataset <em>is</em> and how it behaves, before a single number appears on the page.

</p>

</section>

## 🧩 The Shared Visual Grammar

Before we look at individual icons, here’s the common design grammar they all share.

-   **Cyan circle as frame.**\
    Every icon sits in a bright cyan ring. It marks the design as part of the Insightful Tales family, and suggests a bounded, structured view of the world — a dataset as a lens.

-   **Abstract rather than literal.**\
    No airplanes, no globes, no logos. Each icon uses minimal geometry — arcs, lines, dots, blocks — to capture the <em>structure</em> of the data instead of its surface aesthetics.

-   **Consistent weight and geometry.**\
    Line weights and shapes are kept consistent, so very different domains (flights, weather, urban form, economics, games) still feel like they belong to the same library.

-   **Context-aware usage.**

    -   Small badge (`.dataset-badge-icon`) in lists and “Featured Datasets”.\
    -   Hero badge (`.dataset-icon-hero`) at the top of dataset pages.\
    -   Tiny source badge (`.dataset-icon-small`) in story footers like “Dataset: nycflights13”.

## ✈️ nycflights13 — The Dataset That Took Off

:::: icon-explainer
<img src="images/dataset-icons/nycflights13.svg" class="dataset-badge-icon" aria-hidden="true"/>

::: icon-explainer-text
**What you see**

-   A stylized, angular path inside the circle.
-   A sense of origin and destination, with a central kink that feels like movement.

**What it represents**

-   The **path** hints at flight legs and routing.
-   The **angle** suggests direction and schedules — departures and arrivals rather than a static point.
-   The **circle** is the air traffic system around NYC, seen as a whole.

Together, the icon says: this is a dataset of **routes, timings, and connections** — a structured, navigable map of flights.

## 🚇 TfL Open Data — The Network Beneath the City

:::: icon-explainer
<img src="images/dataset-icons/tfl.svg" class="dataset-badge-icon" aria-hidden="true"/>

::: icon-explainer-text
**What you see**

-   Crisscrossing lines.
-   Two solid circular nodes where lines meet.

**What it represents**

-   The **lines** are routes — Tube lines, rail paths, bus corridors.
-   The **nodes** are interchanges and stations, where flows intersect.
-   The **circle** is the entire transit network as a single organism.

TfL’s data is about **movement on a graph** — this icon foregrounds routes, intersections, and connectivity.

## 🛒 UCI Online Retail — Baskets and Transactions

:::: icon-explainer
<img src="images/dataset-icons/uci-online-retail.svg" class="dataset-badge-icon" aria-hidden="true"/>

::: icon-explainer-text
**What you see**

-   A rounded rectangle with horizontal lines (a “mini invoice” or basket).
-   An arrow-like element extending outward.

**What it represents**

-   The **rectangle** is a basket or invoice: one order, many line items.
-   The **horizontal lines** stand in for products in that order.
-   The **arrow** suggests a completed transaction — an event in time.
-   The **circle** frames the marketplace as a system.

This icon marks datasets about **customers, orders, and items**, where the grain of the data is the transaction.

## 📈 FRED Economic Data — The Macro Curve

:::: icon-explainer
<img src="images/dataset-icons/fred.svg" class="dataset-badge-icon" aria-hidden="true"/>

::: icon-explainer-text
**What you see**

-   A horizontal baseline.
-   A rising-and-falling curve with three markers.

**What it represents**

-   The **baseline** is time — months, quarters, years.
-   The **curve** is a simplified business cycle: expansions and recessions.
-   The **dots** are key readings or indicators: unemployment, inflation, GDP.
-   The **circle** is the macroeconomic landscape.

FRED’s icon is about **time-series indicators in motion**, not any single statistic.

## 🎨 How to Read and Use These Icons

-   When you see a **small badge next to a dataset name**, it’s there to quickly signal the dataset’s “shape” — flights, cities, climate, economics, etc.
-   When you see a **large badge at the top of a dataset page**, it’s a visual “cover” for that particular dataset, echoing the stories it can tell.
-   When you see a **small badge in a story footer** (“Dataset: …”), it helps you connect the narrative you just read with the underlying dataset page, so you can explore further.

Over time, this icon language is meant to feel familiar: even before you read a title, a quick glance at the symbol will tell you <em>what kind of world</em> you’re about to step into — flights, weather, cities, games, baseball, macroeconomics, Earth systems, and more.
