But the truth is: data is as old as civilization itself. Before there were scientists, there were record-keepers. Before there were models, there were marks — clay scratches, tally sticks, and census scrolls — all born from the same instinct: to *remember what mattered*.\n\nThe Babylonians were counting grain before they were writing poems. Their cuneiform tablets, pressed by reeds into wet clay, weren’t stories — they were inventories. It was there, in those humble lists of barley and livestock, that data first became a language of power. Whoever held the counts held control — of taxes, of armies, of life itself.\n\nBy the time the Romans perfected their census, data had become governance. “Censere” meant “to assess,” and that act of assessment — of converting people into numbers — laid the foundation for everything from imperial logistics to modern public policy. The Census wasn’t invented by democracy; democracy was, in part, made possible *because* we learned to count ourselves.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span aria-hidden=\"true\">️🔢✨</span> The Spiritual Act of Counting\n\nI often think about counting not as a mechanical act, but a spiritual one — a human attempt to find order in chaos. Every tally is a quiet declaration that something exists, that it *matters enough to be counted*.\n\nFlorence Nightingale understood this profoundly. When she gathered data on deaths in the Crimean War, she wasn’t collecting for curiosity’s sake. She was fighting ignorance with numbers, transforming rows and columns into a moral argument — one so compelling that even the Queen could not ignore it. In that sense, she pioneered not just data visualization but *data empathy*.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span aria-hidden=\"true\">🌍📈🚀</span> When the World Scaled Up\n\nFast forward to the Victorian era: the world began to count everything. The first statistical societies formed, censuses became national events, and the idea of “objective truth through measurement” took hold. The machine age demanded data — and humanity obliged.\n\nThe story of data from then onward is exponential. By 1900, nearly every industrialized nation had institutionalized statistical offices. By 1950, computers were born to count faster than any human could. By 2000, data had multiplied to such a degree that it began describing *us* more than we described it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span aria-hidden=\"true\">📊🪞</span> The Data of Data\n\nI find something poetic in tracing this lineage with modern tools. Using the **World Bank’s historical population dataset**, we can visualize how humanity’s capacity to count itself expanded almost in lockstep with its population.\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"globe\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(WDI)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\nowid <- get_owid_world_pop()\n\n# --- WDI (1960+) ---\nwdi_raw <- try(\n  WDI(indicator = \"SP.POP.TOTL\",\n      start = 1960,\n      end   = as.integer(format(Sys.Date(), \"%Y\"))),\n  silent = TRUE\n)\n\nif (inherits(wdi_raw, \"try-error\")) {\n  wdi_world <- tibble(year = integer(), pop = numeric())\n} else {\n  # Filter to the global aggregate\n  wdi_world <- wdi_raw %>%\n    filter(iso2c == \"1W\" | country == \"World\") %>%\n    select(year, pop = SP.POP.TOTL)\n}\n\n\n# --- OWID historical (ensure correct columns + units) ---\n\ntmp <- owid %>%\nclean_names() %>%\nrename(pop = population)\n\nif (\"entity\" %in% names(tmp) && any(tolower(tmp$entity) == \"world\")) {\nowid_world <- tmp %>%\nfilter(tolower(entity) == \"world\", !is.na(year), !is.na(pop)) %>%\ndistinct(year, .keep_all = TRUE)\n} else {\n\n# Fallback: aggregate across all entities per year\n\nowid_world <- tmp %>%\ngroup_by(year) %>%\nsummarise(pop = sum(pop, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n}\n\n# Normalize OWID units if provided in millions\n\nif (max(owid_world$pop, na.rm = TRUE) < 1e6) {\nowid_world <- owid_world %>% mutate(pop = pop * 1e6)\n}\n\nggplot() +\ngeom_area(data = owid_world, aes(year, pop / 1e9), alpha = 0.2) +\ngeom_line(data = wdi_world,  aes(year, pop / 1e9)) +\ngeom_vline(xintercept = 1960, linetype = \"dotted\") +\nannotate(\n\"text\",\nx = 1961,\ny = max(c(owid_world$pop, wdi_world$pop), na.rm = TRUE) / 1e9 * 0.9,\nlabel = \"Official WDI begins (1960)\",\nhjust = 0, size = 3\n) +\nlabs(\ntitle = \"World Population: 1800–present\",\nsubtitle = \"Historical (shaded, OWID/Maddison) with modern WDI overlay (solid line)\",\nx = NULL, y = \"Billions\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![World population since 1800, with modern WDI overlay](genesis-of-data_files/figure-html/fig-world-population-long-1.png){#fig-world-population-long width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n> **Methods Note.** Historical population is sourced from OWID/Maddison where available; modern population (1960–present) uses World Bank WDI `SP.POP.TOTL`. If the build environment lacks internet, a small offline fallback ensures the chart still renders.\n\nOverlay that with **Our World in Data’s historical metrics**, and you see an even deeper pattern: as soon as we can measure something, we seek to *improve* it. Counting life expectancy didn’t just describe longevity — it helped extend it. Tracking literacy didn’t just record education — it democratized it.\n\nThis is the unseen virtue of data: it doesn’t just observe reality, it *amplifies intention*.\n\n## <span aria-hidden=\"true\">🔢🧠💫</span> When Counting Became Knowing\n\nThe modern data scientist, in some sense, is a direct descendant of the temple scribe.\\\nWe still look for structure in chaos, still seek to compress the infinite world into finite symbols. The clay tablets became spreadsheets; the grain records became gigabytes. But the human motive remains unchanged: to understand, to predict, to improve.\n\nWe often hear that data is “the new oil.” I don’t think that’s true. Oil is extracted, consumed, and gone. Data, when treated properly, is more like light — it illuminates. The Babylonians’ grain counts, Nightingale’s diagrams, Tukey’s exploratory plots — all were small sparks in a long illumination that continues through every dataset we open today.\n\n## <span aria-hidden=\"true\">🌱⏳</span>A Living Timeline\n\nI’m building an **animated time-series visualization** that traces this evolution: each point represents the earliest known record of a nation’s statistical data — census, agricultural, financial, environmental.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"bar-chart\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Example placeholder visualization\n\nset.seed(42)\ndf <- tibble(\n        year = rep(1800:2020, each = 1),\n        countries_reporting = pmin(\n            200, round(5 + (year - 1800)^1.3 / 3000)\n        )\n    )\n\nggplot(df, aes(year, countries_reporting)) + \n    geom_line(linewidth = 1.2, color = \"#0072B2\") + \n    labs(title = \"A Living Timeline of Data\", subtitle = \"How measurement spread across nations (1800–2020)\",y = \"Countries with available data\", x = NULL)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Data density over time — number of countries recording key statistics](genesis-of-data_files/figure-html/fig-data-timeline-1.png){#fig-data-timeline width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThe story the data tells is breathtaking: we are a species that counts because we *care*.\n\n## <span aria-hidden=\"true\">♾️🧮</span> Epilogue: The Infinite Ledger\n\nWe are, each of us, a new line in the world’s oldest dataset — the ongoing attempt to make sense of being alive.\\\nThe Genesis of Data is not a past event; it’s a continuous present.\\\nEvery number we collect is a reflection of what we value, and every dataset we publish is a quiet hope that someone, somewhere, might find meaning in it.\n\nData, at its most human level, is not about numbers. It’s about noticing.\n\n## <span aria-hidden=\"true\">📚</span> References\n\n-   [World Bank Historical Population Data (1800–present)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)\n\n-   [Our World in Data — History of Statistics](https://ourworldindata.org/)\n\n-   [UN Data Portal: National Census Records Archive](https://data.un.org/)\n",
