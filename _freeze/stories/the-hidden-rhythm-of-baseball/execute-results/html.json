Some eras feel quick and scrappy, others patient and thunderous. In this story, we’ll *listen* to that tempo using long‑run league averages. If you don’t speak data — no problem. Think of every chart as a **stethoscope** on the game’s chest.\n\n### [🧰]{aria-hidden=\"true\"} What data are we using?\n\nWe’ll use the well‑known **Lahman** database (public, free) through R. We’ll count simple things anyone can grasp: **runs**, **home runs**, **walks**, **strikeouts**, and **stolen bases**. From these counts, we compute commonsense rates, like “home runs **per plate appearance**.”\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(Lahman)\n\n# Safe rate helper\nrate <- function(n, d) ifelse(d > 0, n / d, NA_real_)\n\n# Build league-level season summary from Teams\nseason <- Teams %>%\n  transmute(\n    year = yearID,\n    g   = G,\n    r   = R,\n    hr  = HR,\n    bb  = BB,\n    so  = SO,\n    sb  = SB,\n    ab  = AB,\n    hbp = coalesce(HBP, 0L),\n    sf  = coalesce(SF, 0L),\n    pa  = AB + BB + hbp + sf\n  ) %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarise(\n    g      = sum(g,  na.rm = TRUE),\n    r_pg   = rate(sum(r,  na.rm = TRUE), g),\n    # Use summed plate appearances; if pa has gaps early on, fall back to AB+BB\n    pa_sum = sum(pa, na.rm = TRUE),\n    abbb   = sum(ab + bb, na.rm = TRUE),\n    denom  = ifelse(pa_sum > 0, pa_sum, abbb),\n\n    hr_pa  = rate(sum(hr, na.rm = TRUE), denom),\n    bb_pa  = rate(sum(bb, na.rm = TRUE), denom),\n    so_pa  = rate(sum(so, na.rm = TRUE), denom),\n    sb_pa  = rate(sum(sb, na.rm = TRUE), denom)\n  ) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  arrange(year) %>%\n  mutate(\n    # 5-year right-aligned moving average using base R (no zoo needed)\n    rpg_roll5 = as.numeric(stats::filter(r_pg, rep(1/5, 5), sides = 1)),\n    tto_share = hr_pa + bb_pa + so_pa,\n    bip_share = pmax(0, 1 - tto_share)\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\\\n**Decoder**\n\n-   *per PA* ≈ per trip to the plate.\n\n-   *Runs per game* = average runs a team scores in a game that year.\n\n-   *Balls in play* = anything that isn’t a HR, walk, or strikeout.\n:::\n\n## [🎼]{aria-hidden=\"true\"} A Heartbeat You Can See: Runs Per Game\n\nIf the game were breathing, **runs per game** would be its chest rising and falling. Peaks = lively offense. Valleys = pitcher‑dominated eras.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nseason %>%\n    ggplot(aes(year, r_pg)) +\n    geom_line(alpha = 0.85) +\n    geom_line(aes(y = rpg_roll5), linewidth = 1.1) +\n    labs(\n        title = \"Runs per Team Game over Time\",\n        subtitle = \"The 5‑year smoother reveals gentle waves rather than a straight trend\",\n        x = NULL, y = \"Runs per game\"\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-hidden-rhythm-of-baseball_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**What to notice:** The line **waves**. Offense doesn’t simply climb forever — it **surges and recedes** across generations.\n\n## [💥]{aria-hidden=\"true\"} Fewer Things Happen, Louder When They Do\n\nModern baseball increasingly ends in one of three ways: **home run, walk, or strikeout**. That means fewer balls are fielded. The game can *feel* slower between bursts of action, even while the big moments are bigger.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nseason %>%\n    select(year, hr_pa, bb_pa, so_pa) %>%\n    pivot_longer(-year, names_to = \"metric\", values_to = \"rate\"\n    ) %>%\n    mutate(\n        metric = recode(metric,\n        hr_pa = \"Home runs per PA\",\n        bb_pa = \"Walks per PA\",\n        so_pa = \"Strikeouts per PA\")\n    ) %>%\n    ggplot(aes(year, rate, linetype = metric)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    labs(\n        title = \"The Three True Outcomes over Time\",\n        subtitle = \"Share per plate appearance (league average)\",\n        x = NULL, y = \"Rate\"\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-hidden-rhythm-of-baseball_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**What to notice:** Strikeouts climb steadily; home runs rise in bursts; walks bob up and down. Together they take up **more of the action pie**.\n\n## [🧶]{aria-hidden=\"true\"} Thread Count: How Much Play Is *In* Play?\n\nLet’s peek at the **share of balls in play** — the portion of plate appearances that *require* a fielder to do something.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nseason %>%\n    ggplot(aes(year, bip_share)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    labs(\n        title = \"Balls In Play as a Share of All Plate Appearances\",\n        subtitle = \"When this falls, the game has fewer fielding plays and more all‑or‑nothing outcomes\",\n        x = NULL, y = \"Share (0–1)\"\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-hidden-rhythm-of-baseball_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**What to notice:** When this dips, the game’s rhythm changes — fewer sprints and throws, more waiting for the next big swing.\n\n## [🏃]{aria-hidden=\"true\"} Speed’s Comeback Arc\n\nSteals add heartbeat. Their rise and fall shows how teams toggle between **risk** and **power**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nseason %>%\n    ggplot(aes(year, sb_pa)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    labs(\n        title = \"Stolen Bases per Plate Appearance\",\n        subtitle = \"Risk tolerance in motion\",\n        x = NULL, y = \"SB per PA\"\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-hidden-rhythm-of-baseball_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**What to notice:** Cycles. The sport rediscovering speed isn’t nostalgia — it’s ecology. When defenses and pitchers neutralize power, **movement** becomes valuable again.\n\n## [🌀]{aria-hidden=\"true\"} A Simple “Zeit Rhythm” Index\n\nTo summarize the *feel* of an era, we blend four dials:\n\n-   **Power** (HR/PA)\n\n-   **Miss** (SO/PA)\n\n-   **Movement** (SB/PA)\n\n-   **Play in the Field** (Balls in play share, but we subtract it — less BIP = more all‑or‑nothing feel)\n\nThe result is a single line: higher = louder, burstier baseball; lower = more contact‑heavy flow.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nzi <- season %>%\n  mutate(across(c(hr_pa, so_pa, sb_pa, bip_share), scale)) %>%\n  mutate(ZI = as.numeric(hr_pa + so_pa + sb_pa - bip_share)) %>%\n  mutate(ZI_roll5 = as.numeric(stats::filter(ZI, rep(1/5, 5), sides = 1))) %>%\n  select(year, ZI, ZI_roll5)\n\n\n\nzi %>% \n    ggplot(aes(year, ZI)) +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linewidth = 0.3) +\n    geom_line(alpha = 0.55) +\n    geom_line(aes(y = ZI_roll5), linewidth = 1.1) +\n    labs(\n        title = \"Zeit Rhythm Index\",\n        subtitle = \"A blended, z‑scored feel of power + miss + movement − balls in play\",\n        x = NULL, y = \"Index (0 ≈ average era)\"\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](the-hidden-rhythm-of-baseball_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**What to notice:** The line **oscillates in multi‑decade waves** rather than drifting randomly — a hint that baseball self‑corrects when any one style takes over.\n\n## [🔭]{aria-hidden=\"true\"} What This Suggests Next\n\n-   **Contact renaissance**: As pitchers and defenses optimize for strikeouts and power prevention, putting the ball in play may regain value — not as nostalgia, but as an *edge*.\n\n-   **Smart speed**: Selective stealing and hit‑and‑run tactics may return in pockets where they exploit pitcher/catcher timing.\n\n-   **Fielding theater**: If leagues want more visible action, rule tweaks that increase balls in play could shift the rhythm again.\n\n## [📦]{aria-hidden=\"true\"} Reproducibility Notes\n\n-   **Source**: The public **Lahman** database via the `Lahman` R package.\n\n-   **Averages**: We averaged teams into a single league line per year to hear the broad rhythm (details will vary by ballpark or league).\n\n-   **Approximations**: Older seasons are missing some counts (like sacrifice flies). We used simple, conservative fallbacks that don’t change the big picture.\n\n-   **Smoothing**: A gentle 5‑year average makes the waves easier to see.\n\n## [📚]{aria-hidden=\"true\"} References & Credits\n\n-   **Sean Lahman** — *Lahman Baseball Database* (public historical stats).\n\n-   **Lahman (R package, CRAN)** — convenient access to the database.\n\n-   **tidyverse (CRAN)** — data wrangling and plotting in R.\n\n-   **zoo (CRAN)** — rolling averages.\n\n*Inspirations:* FanGraphs and Baseball‑Reference for longstanding public analytics; the broader sabermetric community for opening up the conversation.\n",
